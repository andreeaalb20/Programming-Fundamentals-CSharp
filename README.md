# C# Algorithmic Foundations - Problem Set #1

A collection of 21 C# implementations focusing on core computational logic, mathematical algorithms, and fundamental programming structures.

## Key Implementations
* **Mathematical Logic:** Linear/quadratic equations, leap year calculation, and triangle properties.
* **Number Theory:** Prime detection, GCD/LCM (Euclidean algorithm), prime factorization, and divisors.
* **Advanced Logic:** * **Palindrome Check:** Number symmetry validation.
    * **Fraction Analysis:** Conversion of fractions to decimals with periodic notation (e.g., `0.4(3)`).
    * **Binary Search Strategy:** An interactive number-guessing game using interval halving.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Uncomment the specific problem method in `Main()` (e.g., `Problema20();`).
3. Press `F5` to execute.
